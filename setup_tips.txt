1. run: npm init -y (in the project folder)
2. run: npm install vite (this installs the node_modules folder and the package-lock.json file and adds the dependencies to package.json)
3. edit the package.json file to add the following scripts (this allows running the vite commands from the command line (npm run dev or npm run build)): 
    "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build"
    },
4. run: npm run dev (this starts the development server)
5. Add Javascript by creating a new file script.js, there add the following code:
    console.log('Hello from Vite!'); ()
6. Add the script tag to the index.html file:
    <script src="/src/script.js"></script>
7. check the sever, inspect -> console, you should see the message "Hello from Vite!"
8. install three.js: npm install three (three should be in node_modules)
9. run npm run dev
10. in script.js add the following code:
    import * as THREE from 'three';
    console.log(THREE);
