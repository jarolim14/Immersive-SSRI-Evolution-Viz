      "Welcome to a visual journey through the library of SSRI research papers. Before you lies the comprehensive published literature on the most commonly prescribed class of antidepressants, spanning over 35,000 research papers from 1982 to 2025.\n\nEach dot in the scene represents a scientific publication, whereas the edges represent citations and semantic relationships between them. Colors distinguish different research domains such as 'Pharmacology', 'Indications', and 'Safety'. Notice how subtle variations in shade indicate subdomains within each research area. Colored lines connect papers within the same research cluster, while connections between different clusters appear in gray.\n\nFeel free to explore this knowledge landscape â€” orbit around the scene with your mouse, zoom in to examine specific clusters and single papers, or pull back to appreciate the broader research patterns.",
